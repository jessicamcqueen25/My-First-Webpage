<center><h1>Mrs. McQueen's Classroom Gallery</h1></center>
<p>Welcome to our classroom gallery. These photographs showcase what our students have been making for our school-based enterprise, <i>The Rowdy Raccoon Station</i>! They have worked very hard to create key chains, ear rings, bracelets, and more to sell to our teachers and staff. The students also make goods to sell at festivals and events in Irvine, KY. The students have several skills they use when working towards gaining career hours (KY requires all MSD students at the high school level to have 40 career hours a year) such as communication skills, motor skills, color coordination, pricing and selling skills, taking inventory, ordering supplies, stocking supplies, and more!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy these photos as much as we enjoyed the experience! I have parental approval to share these photos on my webpage.</p>
